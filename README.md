Blood Group Detection from Fingerprint Images 🩸🖐️

🚀 Project Overview

This project is a deep learning-based system that predicts a person’s blood group from their fingerprint images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Users can upload fingerprint images via a web interface, and the model predicts one of the four blood groups: A, B, AB, or O.

Backend: CNN model in TensorFlow/Keras

Frontend: Flask web app

Deployment: Google Colab + ngrok (or future serverless deployment)

🎯 Motivation

Traditional blood group detection requires blood samples.

Using fingerprints provides a non-invasive alternative.

Learn deep learning, computer vision, and web deployment in one project.

📂 Dataset

Fingerprint images labeled with blood groups.

Preprocessing includes:

Resizing to 128x128 pixels

Normalizing pixel values to [0,1]

One-hot encoding blood group labels

Folder structure:

dataset/
    A/
    B/
    AB/
    O/

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python – Programming language

TensorFlow / Keras – CNN model development

Flask – Web application for predictions

ngrok – Expose local Flask app as public URL

Google Colab – GPU-enabled cloud environment

📈 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Resize all images to 128x128 pixels.

Normalize pixel values.

Split dataset into training (80%) and validation (20%).

2️⃣ CNN Architecture

3 Convolutional layers with ReLU activation

MaxPooling layers for dimensionality reduction

Flatten layer → Dense layers → Dropout (0.5)

Softmax activation for multi-class classification
